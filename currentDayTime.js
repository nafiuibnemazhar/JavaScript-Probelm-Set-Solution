/**
 * Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format.
Today is : Tuesday.
Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38

This JavaScript program retrieves the current date and time, determines the day of the week, and formats the current hour, minute, and second in 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It then prints the day of the week and the formatted current time to the console. The program also handles special cases for "Noon" and "Midnight" to ensure an accurate representation.
